## Idea

The world around has shifted to a life in the fast lane, where the change is the only constant. In this fast paced world we as students take it as our duty to automate anything and everything we lay our eyes on. 
However the capacity of our brain remains limited and the events the younger generation will experience will be forgotten and may vanish from our memory before we know it.
Vishnu and I as budding philosophers believe that these moments and experiences are priceless as anything else and desperately need to be documented for us. 


## Proposition   (Will definitely be vague at first)
We wish to build a personal digital assistant for each individual that downloads this application.
Will keep track of (if authorized):
    Places we have been to
    Our flagged moments, achievements or awards and even failures if we wish
    a To-Do list
    An up to date working resume of an entirely different kind.
